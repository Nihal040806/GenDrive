# GenDrive
This project is a Full-Stack AI Simulation where autonomous agents (vehicles) learn to navigate complex tracks without human intervention. Instead of traditional programming, the system uses Neuro-Evolution—a combination of Neural Networks for decision-making and Genetic Algorithms for optimization—to evolve intelligent behavior over generations.
